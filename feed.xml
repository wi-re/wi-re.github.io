$('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"/> </picture> </figure> <p>Shown here is a distribution of relative particle positions sampled over a few timesteps (left) and for a single step (right). In the ground truth we see a clear formation of two <em>rings</em> at $\Delta x$ and $2\Delta x$ with a minimum particle separation but an otherwise uniform distribution. Now consider a machine learning trajectory:</p> <figure> <picture> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" srcset="/assets/img/2023-05-22-13-18-55-480.webp 480w,/assets/img/2023-05-22-13-18-55-800.webp 800w,/assets/img/2023-05-22-13-18-55-1400.webp 1400w," type="image/webp" sizes="95vw"/> <img src="/assets/img/2023-05-22-13-18-55.png" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" width="100%" height="auto" title="example image" loading="lazy" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"/> </picture> </figure> <p>Here we still see the two rings and uniformity but the minimum particle separation is lower. This can often lead to issues during inference as those distributions are not included in the training data, albeit this can be reduced in impact by using unroll noise and data augmentation (to an extent). Now consider this method:</p> <figure> <picture> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" srcset="/assets/img/2023-05-22-13-19-31-480.webp 480w,/assets/img/2023-05-22-13-19-31-800.webp 800w,/assets/img/2023-05-22-13-19-31-1400.webp 1400w," type="image/webp" sizes="95vw"/> <img src="/assets/img/2023-05-22-13-19-31.png" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" width="100%" height="auto" title="example image" loading="lazy" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"/> </picture> </figure> <p>Which shows a highly biased distribution that aligns much closer to a rectilinear grid than an isotroptic distribution with a much lower minimum distance between particles. While this looks worse, and arguably is, this method is more stable in a lot of cases as this distribution acts as a stabilizing measure by regularizing the particle positions, similar to particle shifting. Note that the real reason we got these results was that the method in the last picture wasnt implemented properly and the <em>bug</em> lead to an interesting and, somewhat, improved result.</p>]]></content><author><name></name></author><category term="sample-posts"/><category term="formatting"/><category term="code"/><summary type="html"><![CDATA[Cross-Validation for Machine Learning]]></summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Sfbc</title><link href="https://fluids.dev/blog/2024/SFBC/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Sfbc"/><published>2024-01-01T00:00:00+00:00</published><updated>2024-01-01T00:00:00+00:00</updated><id>https://fluids.dev/blog/2024/SFBC</id><content type="html" xml:base="https://fluids.dev/blog/2024/SFBC/"><![CDATA[<hr/> <p>layout: post title: SFBC (ICLR 2024) date: 2024-05-01 00:32:13 description: A collection of questions and information about our ICLR paper tags: formatting code categories: sample-posts</p> <h1 id="tabs-true">tabs: true</h1> <p>featured: true â€”</p> <h1 id="symmetric-fourier-basis-convolutions-for-learning-lagrangian-fluid-simulations">Symmetric Fourier Basis Convolutions for Learning Lagrangian Fluid Simulations</h1> <p>Authors: Rene Winchenbach, Nils Thuerey</p> <p>Accepted at: International Conference on Learning Representation (ICLR) 2024 - Vienna (as a Poster)</p> <p>If you have any questions on the paper itself or Continuous Convolutions in general, feel free to reach out to me via rene.winchenbach@tum.de</p> <p>Frequently asked questions about the paper will appear here as they are asked.</p> <p>Q: Can the method handle oversampled or undersampled data during inference related to training? A: No. The internal formulation of the Graph Convolution does not account for the volume of the contributing nodes, which works for our purposes as we are only dealing with uniformly sized particles and thus the volume is a constant term that can be ignored. However, if you wanted to do this you would need to change the Graph Convolution formulation to include volume.</p> <p>Q: What about scaling to other resolutions? A: Our method cannot handle this as there is some general uncertainty about particle resolutions as (a) scalar quantities in our SPH data scale with $h^{-d}$ and gradients with $h^{-d-1}$ and thus learning resolution varying quantities would require including this support much more tightly into the training. While this could potentially work, we did not investigate this for now.</p> <p>Q: What about adaptive resolutions? A: Similar to the prior question, this could conceptually be added to the network but makes the training significantly more complicated as there are many potential constellations of relative sizes and distributions a particle can see. This would make the dataset generation significantly harder and was beyond our scope.</p> <p>Q: What is the resolution to Fourier Neural Operators/Do you use FFTs? A: No. Our method works in normal coordinate space and not in a global frequency space. Instead our method works on a local limited convolution where we use the Fourier Terms to represent a filter function.</p> <p>Q: What about other appications? A: We did try our method on some general Pattern Recognitiion tasks but including these results was beyond our scope. Our Codebase can be applied to general graph tasks similar to how pyTorch geometric works.</p> <p>Q: What about larger simulations? A: Our method can readily do this due to its local Graph Convolution architecture. Accordingly, we can simply expand the simulation domain to be larger. Furthermore, the memory consumption during inference is relatively small so it would be possible to use multiple orders of magnitude more particles during inference if so desired.</p> <p>Q: How do you encode boundaries? A: Periodic boundaries are modeled by connecting particles across the periodic boundary with appropriate modular distances. Rigid boundaries are included with rigid particles with a seperate CConv on the first network layer.</p> <p>Repository: https://github.com/tum-pbs/SFBC ArXiV Paper: https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.16680</p>]]></content><author><name></name></author><summary type="html"><![CDATA[layout: post title: SFBC (ICLR 2024) date: 2024-05-01 00:32:13 description: A collection of questions and information about our ICLR paper tags: formatting code categories: sample-posts tabs: true featured: true â€”]]></summary></entry></feed>
