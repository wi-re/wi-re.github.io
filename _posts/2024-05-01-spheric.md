# 18th International Smoothed Particle Hydrodynamics Research and Engineering International Community Workshop

We have two papers in the proceedings this year:

## Physically-Motivated Machine Learning Models for Lagrangian Fluid Mechanics

In this paper we talk about recent experiences and insights into machine learning for fluid mechanics, specifically Lagrangian ones. In this context we give an overview of some best practices and how we can bring CFD and ML knowledge together to build a bridge towards the future.

This paper will be presented orally in Berlin and you can find the full paper in this repository (https://github.com/wi-re/spheric2024 or at this [url](https://github.com/wi-re/spheric2024/blob/main/Physics_Based_ML___SPHERIC_2024.pdf)

You can also find the slides [here](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1e02A_wJwa9tPF9eBA0_XZiz2FKnaNUiF/edit?usp=drive_link&ouid=107302498783065501890&rtpof=true&sd=true)
